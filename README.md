# Team-Builder

## Project Description

As a web developer I want to be able to generate a project team and assign specific roles to people. Not only assigning roles to people, but to have their contact information handy as well. With this project I wanted to generate a team that had a manager, an engineer, and an intern. Of course with this application one can change the codes to fit any role possible and assign people to designated roles.

## Development

I would have to say the development of this project was challenging as I was rewatching class videos over the course of two days before starting project. I didn't really understand how to run the test correctly, but taking notes about how to run jest I was finally able to get test to run. However this wasn't the only problem that I ran into, with the started code provided, I had to create functions from the lib file to match one another. The process of this project application I was able get a good understanding on how to run tests, how to use modules, how to create constructors and class. Check out the documentation on how this application works down below.

## Documentation

Here is a small demonstration of how to run the test in the terminal in VS code.

Now if the quality of the GIF isn't so clear on how this was run. Check the image below.

Here is what the application looks like when you run the file on node.

Now quality of GIF isn't so good, so I included the end snippet of the inputs I did for my test team.

Most definitely I know that the quality of the GIF does not have good quality, so here is the [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/dbkfmjkjdW0) to the fully demo of running the test as well as the application.
