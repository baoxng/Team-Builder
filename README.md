# Team-Builder

## Project Description

As a web developer I want to be able to generate a project team and assign specific roles to people. Not only assigning roles to people, but to have their contact information handy as well. With this project I wanted to generate a team that had a manager, an engineer, and an intern. Of course with this application one can change the codes to fit any role possible and assign people to designated roles.

## Development

I would have to say the development of this project was challenging as I was rewatching class videos over the course of two days before starting project. I didn't really understand how to run the test correctly, but taking notes about how to run jest I was finally able to get test to run. However this wasn't the only problem that I ran into, with the started code provided, I had to create functions from the lib file to match one another. The process of this project application I was able get a good understanding on how to run tests, how to use modules, how to create constructors and class. Check out the documentation on how this application works down below.

## Documentation

Here is a small demonstration of how to run the test in the terminal in VS code.
