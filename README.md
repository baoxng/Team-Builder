# Team-Builder

## Project Description

As a web developer I want to be able to generate a project team and assign specific roles to people. Not only assigning roles to people, but to have their contact information handy as well. With this project I wanted to generate a team that had a manager, an engineer, and an intern. Of course with this application one can change the codes to fit any role possible and assign people to designated roles.
